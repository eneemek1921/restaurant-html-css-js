# La Famiglia — Restaurant SPA

The training project is a restaurant website with SPA navigation.  
It was made to practice dynamic content loading, working with Fetch API, and creating interactive UI without frameworks.

**Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)

## ✨ What's done

- SPA navigation — three pages (Main, List, About) load without page reload
- Fade-in animation when switching pages
- Interactive dish cards — click to scale
- A long immersive story page about the restaurant's history
- Structured project folders (HTML, CSS, JS, data)

The project was created for educational purposes to practice async JavaScript, Fetch API, and modular code organization.
