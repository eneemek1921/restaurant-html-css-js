        <h1>Our history</h1>
        <p>In the small coastal town of Positano, Italy, in 1952, a young boy named Giovanni would watch his grandmother, Nonna Rosa, cook for the family every evening. The kitchen was always filled with the smell of fresh basil, simmering tomatoes, and warm bread. Nonna Rosa never used a recipe book. She cooked with her heart, with passion, and with love. One evening, Giovanni asked his grandmother: "Nonna, how do you know exactly how much salt to add?" She smiled and replied: "The food tells you, Giovanni. You just have to listen." That moment changed Giovanni's life forever. He knew that one day, he would share his grandmother's cooking with the world.</p>
        <p>At the age of 22, Giovanni moved to America with only two suitcases and a notebook filled with his grandmother's recipes. He arrived in New York City with no money, no connections, but with a burning dream: to open a restaurant that would bring the taste of Italy to the heart of Manhattan. For three years, Giovanni worked as a dishwasher in a small diner. Every night, after finishing his shift, he would stay in the kitchen and practice. He made the same pasta his grandmother taught him — over and over again — until it was perfect. The other cooks laughed at him. "You'll never own a restaurant," they said. But Giovanni didn't listen. He remembered Nonna Rosa's words: "Listen to the food, not to the noise."</p>
        <p>In 1978, with money saved from years of working double shifts, Giovanni finally opened the doors of "La Famiglia" — a small restaurant with only five tables. The walls were covered with photos of Positano, and in the corner hung Nonna Rosa's old wooden spoon. The first month was difficult. Some days, not a single customer walked in. But Giovanni never gave up. He greeted everyone passing by, offered free tastes of his sauce, and treated every guest like family. One evening, a food critic from the New York Times walked in by accident. He was looking for a place to escape the rain and ended up at La Famiglia. Giovanni served him his grandmother's Carbonara. The next week, the review came out. It said: "La Famiglia is not just a restaurant. It's a journey to Italy. Every bite feels like a hug from an Italian grandmother."</p>
        <p>Overnight, the restaurant became famous. People lined up outside, waiting hours for a table. Giovanni's son, Marco, who had grown up helping in the kitchen, joined the business. Together, they moved to a bigger location — the one where La Famiglia still stands today. Giovanni taught Marco the same way Nonna Rosa taught him: not with recipes, but with feeling. "Cooking is not about following rules," Giovanni would say. "It's about understanding ingredients. Tomatoes need time. Pasta needs love. Cheese needs patience." By 1995, La Famiglia had won multiple awards and was considered one of the best Italian restaurants in New York. But Giovanni never changed the menu. He kept it simple: the same dishes Nonna Rosa made, with the same love.</p>
        <p>Today, La Famiglia is run by Marco and his daughter, Sofia — Giovanni's granddaughter. Though Giovanni passed away in 2010, his spirit lives in every plate that leaves the kitchen. Sofia often tells guests: "My grandfather believed that food is more than food. It's memory. It's family. It's home." And when you sit at La Famiglia, surrounded by the photos of Positano and the smell of Nonna Rosa's sauce, you understand. This is not just a restaurant. It's a story. A story that began in a small Italian kitchen and continues today in the heart of New York. A story of love, passion, and the belief that the best recipes are not written down — they are passed from heart to heart.</p>
        <p>If you ever visit, try the Carbonara. Giovanni's grandmother's recipe. It tastes like 1952. It tastes like Italy. It tastes like home.</p>
